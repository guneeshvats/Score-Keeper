The Simple Score Keeper is a lightweight and user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the Bulma framework. It provides a convenient solution for tracking scores in two-player games such as ping pong, where players agree on a predetermined winning score and compete to reach it first.
